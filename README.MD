# JDUMP

A script to manage dumps.

## Setup
Edit `example_config.yml` to your needs and rename it to `config.yml`

Give scripts permission 
```
chmod +x jdump.sh
chmod +x parse_yaml.sh
```

## Usage
`jdump -h`

## Alias
I would recommend setting up an alias for the script.
```
alias jdump='bash /Users/user/scripts/jdump.sh'
```
